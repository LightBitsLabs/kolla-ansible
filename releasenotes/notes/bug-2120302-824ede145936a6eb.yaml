    Added no_log=True to the ``common_options`` argument in generate_module()
    to prevent the auth_password and other sensitive data from being printed
    in Ansible logs during container operations when
    ``docker_registry_password`` was set. This improves security by hiding
    credentials from logs.

    This change addresses the issue where auth_password was visible in log
    despite already having no_log=True on the auth_password parameter itself,
    because it was nested inside common_options dict without no_log protection.
