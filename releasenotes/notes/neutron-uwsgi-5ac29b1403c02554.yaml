    ``Neutron`` deployment has been reworked to use uWSGI for API workers
    and to run additional processes in separate containers (following changes
    in Neutron project).
    Therefore ``neutron-tls-proxy`` service has been dropped and currently
    TLS is terminated on the uWSGI server.
    In addition to this there are new containers/services:

    * neutron-ovn-maintenance-worker
    * neutron-rpc-server
    * neutron-periodic-workers
